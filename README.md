# QuantumComputing

Symbolic Quantum Computing Package for the Wolfram Language. Includes support for qudits, mixed states, and generation of reversible quantum circuits from classical boolean functions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Download a copy of QuantumComputing.m and place this in the directory with the notebook you are trying to run. In an evaluation cell in your notebook, paste and evaluate the following command:

Say what the step will be

```
Get[FileNameJoin[NotebookDirectory[], "QuantumComputing.m"]]
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
