# QuantumComputing

Symbolic Quantum Computing Package for the Wolfram Language. Includes support for qudits, mixed states, and generation of reversible quantum circuits from classical boolean functions. This package began as a project during the Wolfram Summer School 2017, and grew into an internship in Algorithms R&D for Wolfram Research.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Download a copy of QuantumComputing.m and place this in the directory with the notebook you are trying to run. In an evaluation cell in your notebook, paste and evaluate the following command:

```
Get[FileNameJoin[NotebookDirectory[], "QuantumComputing.m"]]
```
